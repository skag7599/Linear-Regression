# Linear-Regression  #

It is used to determine the extent to which there is a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. ... In simple linear regression a single independent variable is used to predict the value of a dependent variable.


Here I have implemented linear regression with one
variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose I am the CEO of a restaurant franchise and considering different cities for opening a new
outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and I have data for
profits and populations from the cities.

I would like to use this data to help me select which city to expand
to next.
The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is
the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a
loss.
